Work in progress. Questions are fetched from DBpedia(poorly as of the minute). The big idea is for the player to battle a bot - making markets and trading on estimates of answers to the given question. The loser of each question loses points in accordance with how wrong they were. First person to lose all of their HP loses the battle. Pokemon meets geoguessr kind of stuff. Need to work on having the bots make sensible markets without giving them the answer. Some fun potential for market of the day (ala NYT games) and markets on upcoming events (like total points in a given match idk). Also would like to focus on stats aspect when gameloop is solid (bot overall PnL sort of stuff) 

_is it fun?_
No, not really

_can i play against my friends?_
No, not yet anyway

Next on the list is to make it pretty and create some bot personas

The game will probably be called 'Reckon Width' since the domain for that doesnt cost a fortune.
